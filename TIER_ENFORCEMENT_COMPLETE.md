## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### 1. Tier Enforcement Flow:

```
User tries to create essay
    ↓
essay-manager.js checks: "Is this a new essay?" (line 299)
    ↓
IF YES: Count existing essays
    ↓
tierEnforcement.checkLimit('maxEssays', currentCount)
    ↓
Compare to user's tier limit (Free: 3, Basic: 10, Pro: ∞)
    ↓
IF OVER LIMIT:
    → Show upgrade modal
    → Block essay creation
    → Return early
    ↓
IF UNDER LIMIT:
    → Allow essay creation
    → Log success message
```

### 2. Usage Meters:

```
Dashboard loads
    ↓
loadUserSubscription() called (line 3242)
    ↓
Load user's subscription tier from Firestore
    ↓
Initialize UsageMeters class
    ↓
Query Firestore for usage data
    ↓
Get tier limits from subscription-config.js
    ↓
Calculate percentage for each resource
    ↓
Render meters with progress bars
    ↓
Color-code based on usage:
    - Green: < 80% used
    - Yellow: 80-99% used (near limit)
    - Red: 100% used (at limit)
```

### 3. Mock Payment Integration:

```
User clicks "Subscribe to Basic"
    ↓
Mock checkout modal appears
    ↓
User clicks "Complete Mock Payment"
    ↓
Firestore updated: tier = "basic"
    ↓
Dashboard reloads
    ↓
Usage meters show new limits (10 essays, 20 questions)
    ↓
Features unlock automatically
```
