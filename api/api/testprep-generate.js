[Clear, complete question text]

A) [Option A text]
B) [Option B text]  
C) [Option C text]
D) [Option D text]

CORRECT: [Letter of correct answer: A, B, C, or D]

EXPLANATION: [Detailed 2-3 sentence explanation of why the answer is correct and how to solve it. Include the reasoning process and key concepts.]

QUESTION 2:
[Next question...]

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each question must be complete and self-contained
- All four answer choices must be plausible but only ONE is correct
- Explanations must teach the concept, not just state the answer
- Use realistic numbers and scenarios
- Ensure questions test understanding, not tricks
- Double-check that the marked correct answer is actually correct`;
