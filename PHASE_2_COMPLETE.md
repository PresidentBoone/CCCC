1. `/scripts/dev-server.js` (58 lines) - Express development server
2. `/scripts/build.js` (115 lines) - Production build script
3. `/scripts/preview.js` (48 lines) - Preview server for built files

**Features**:
- Fast development server with live reload
- Production build copying `/public` → `/dist`
- File counting and size reporting
- Vercel deployment integration
- No code changes required

**Commands**:
```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build            # Build for development

npm run preview          # Preview production build
```

## 🚀 How to Use Accessibility Utilities

### In HTML Pages:

Add these scripts in the `<head>` section (after core utilities):

```html
<!-- Accessibility Layer -->
<script src="/js/a11y/keyboard-nav.js"></script>
<script src="/js/a11y/screen-reader.js"></script>
<script src="/js/a11y/focus-manager.js"></script>
<script src="/js/a11y/a11y-init.js"></script>
```

### In JavaScript Code:

```javascript
// Announce to screen readers
window.screenReader.announceSuccess('Quiz submitted successfully!');
window.screenReader.announceError('Please fill in all required fields');
window.screenReader.announceLoading('Loading questions...');

// Manage focus
window.focusManager.saveFocus(); // Before opening modal
window.focusManager.restoreFocus(previousElement); // After closing modal
window.focusManager.focusFirstIn(modalElement); // Focus first element in modal

// Keyboard navigation
window.keyboardNav.trapFocus(modalElement, returnElement); // Trap focus in modal
window.keyboardNav.releaseFocusTrap(); // Release trap
```

---

## 📋 Integration Checklist

To integrate accessibility into existing pages:

- [ ] Add a11y scripts to `<head>`
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Arrow keys)
- [ ] Test skip links (Tab on page load)
- [ ] Test modal focus trapping (open/close modals)
- [ ] Add `screenReader.announce()` calls for dynamic content
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS)
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test all interactive elements with keyboard only
