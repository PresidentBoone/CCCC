**Moment of Growth:** Think of a specific challenge or failure that taught you something important. How did you change?

**Unique Perspective:** What experiences have shaped how you see the world? What's your unique lens?

**Passion Project:** What do you care deeply about? When you talk about it, do people see your eyes light up?

**Quiet Moments:** Sometimes the best essays are about small, meaningful moments rather than grand achievements.

**Curiosity:** What questions drive you? What do you want to learn more about?

${this.userData?.intendedMajor ? `Since you're interested in ${this.userData.intendedMajor}, you could explore how your experiences led you to this field.` : ''}

What resonates with you? Tell me more about your experiences!`;

**In Media Res (In the Middle):** Start in the middle of a scene or action
‚ùå "I've always been interested in science."
‚úÖ "The beaker shattered, and my hypothesis with it."

**Surprising Statement:** Challenge expectations
‚ùå "Failure taught me lessons."
‚úÖ "My greatest achievement? Losing the championship."

**Specific Detail:** Paint a vivid picture
‚ùå "I was nervous."
‚úÖ "My hands trembled as I adjusted the microscope for the third time."

**Question (use sparingly):** Make them curious
‚úÖ "What does a 2AM fire alarm have to do with leadership?"

The key: Drop readers into a moment that makes them want to keep reading. What's your essay about?`;

        if (msg.includes('show don') || msg.includes('showing') || msg.includes('telling')) {

**Telling:** "I am passionate about helping others."
**Showing:** "Every Tuesday, I teach Mr. Rodriguez English while he teaches me how to make tamales. Last week, when he passed his citizenship test, we both cried."

**Telling:** "I'm a hard worker."
**Showing:** "I wake at 5 AM to practice piano before school, my fingers still stiff from yesterday's three-hour session."

**Telling:** "The moment changed me."
**Showing:** "I used to walk past homeless people. Now I stop, crouch down to eye level, and ask their names."

**The formula:** Replace abstract claims with:
‚Ä¢ Specific actions you took
‚Ä¢ Concrete details (sights, sounds, feelings)
‚Ä¢ Dialogue when relevant
‚Ä¢ What changed in your behavior

Look at your essay‚Äîwhere are you TELLING readers about yourself? Can you SHOW them instead?`;

‚ùå "Making a difference" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Name one specific person you impacted
‚ùå "Passion for helping others" ‚Üí ‚úÖ One detailed story of helping someone
‚ùå "Step outside my comfort zone" ‚Üí ‚úÖ What specifically scared you? What happened?

**Sports Essay Clich√©s:**
‚ùå "Learned teamwork" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Show a specific moment of teamwork
‚ùå "Perseverance through injury" ‚Üí ‚úÖ One vivid day of recovery
‚ùå "Leadership as captain" ‚Üí ‚úÖ One decision you made that mattered

**Cutting Strategy:**
1. Remove generic statements ("I learned a lot")
2. Cut repetitive ideas‚Äîsay it once, memorably
3. Trim weak adjectives and adverbs
4. Remove entire paragraphs that don't advance your story
5. Combine sentences for conciseness

‚Ä¢ Add sensory details where relevant
‚Ä¢ Ensure smooth transitions
‚Ä¢ Make sure your conclusion reflects growth

**What DOESN'T work:**
‚ùå Repeating what you already said
‚ùå "And that's how I learned..."
‚ùå Generic statements about the future
‚ùå Overly grand claims ("I will change the world")

**What WORKS:**
‚úÖ **Echo the Opening:** Return to your opening scene/image, but show how you've changed
‚úÖ **Forward Motion:** One specific action you'll take based on what you learned
‚úÖ **New Insight:** A realization that shifts your perspective
‚úÖ **Quiet Confidence:** Show maturity without being grandiose

**Example:**
Opening: "The beaker shattered, and my hypothesis with it."
Conclusion: "Now when experiments fail, I don't see broken glass‚ÄîI see the beginning of a better question."

**Tailoring Your Essay:**

1. **Research Each School:**
   ‚Ä¢ What values do they emphasize?
   ‚Ä¢ What makes their community unique?
   ‚Ä¢ Read student blogs and course catalogs

2. **Be Specific:**
   ‚ùå "Your strong science program attracts me"
   ‚úÖ "Professor Chen's research on microplastics aligns with my work testing local water quality"

3. **Show Fit:**
   ‚Ä¢ Connect YOUR experiences to THEIR opportunities
   ‚Ä¢ Name specific programs, professors, clubs
   ‚Ä¢ Show you've done your homework

4. **Authentic Interest:**
   Don't force it‚Äîwrite about genuine connections
