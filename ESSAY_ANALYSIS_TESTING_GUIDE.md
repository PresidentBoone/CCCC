2. Check internet connection
3. Wait 60 seconds and try again

### Issue: Results show but no highlights

**This is NORMAL if:**
- Essay is very short
- Essay has no obvious issues
- AI couldn't find specific text to highlight

**Still working correctly if:**
- Overall feedback is present
- Lists have items
- No error messages appear

### Issue: Slow response time
