# College Climb - Setup & Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ installed
- Vercel account (for deployment)
- OpenAI API key
- College Scorecard API key

---

## 📋 Step 1: Environment Variables

### Create `.env` file

Create a file called `.env` in the project root with the following content:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# College Scorecard API Configuration
COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY=your_college_scorecard_api_key_here
```

**Important:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will NOT be committed to git.

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 💻 Step 3: Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## 🌐 Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Add Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY
   vercel env add COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY
   ```

   Or add them via the Vercel dashboard (see Option B).

5. **Redeploy with environment variables:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option B: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Click "Import"

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Navigate to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
   - Add the following variables:

   | Name | Value |
   |------|-------|
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `your_openai_api_key_here` |
   | `COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY` | `your_college_scorecard_api_key_here` |

   **Note:** Use the actual API keys you received. Don't commit these to git!

4. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## 🏗️ New Features Added

### 1. College Search API (`/api/college-search`)

**Usage:**
```javascript
// Search by name
fetch('/api/college-search?name=Stanford')

// Search by state
fetch('/api/college-search?state=CA')

// Pagination
fetch('/api/college-search?name=University&page=2&per_page=10')
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "243744",
      "name": "Stanford University",
      "city": "Stanford",
      "state": "CA",
      "admissionRate": 0.0436,
      "avgSAT": 1505,
      "avgACT": 34,
      "studentSize": 7645,
      "inStateTuition": 56169,
      "outOfStateTuition": 56169,
      "website": "www.stanford.edu"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1
}
```

### 2. College API Helper (`public/js/college-api.js`)

**Usage:**
```javascript
import { searchCollegesByName, createCollegeCard } from './js/college-api.js';

// Search colleges
const results = await searchCollegesByName('Harvard');

// Create HTML cards
const html = results.results.map(college => createCollegeCard(college)).join('');
document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = html;
```

### 3. Logger Utility (`public/js/logger.js`)

**Usage:**
```javascript
import logger from './js/logger.js';

// Only logs in development
logger.log('Debug info:', data);

// Always logs (production + dev)
logger.error('Critical error:', error);
logger.warn('Warning:', warning);
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Firebase Client Keys
The Firebase configuration is in client-side code, which is normal and expected. Firebase uses security rules to protect data, not hidden keys.

**Important:** Make sure Firebase Security Rules are configured!

### API Keys
- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ API keys are only in server-side functions
- ✅ Never exposed to client

### Rate Limiting
- Chat API: 10 requests per minute per user
- College Search: No limit (uses government API)

---

## 📊 API Limits & Costs

### OpenAI API
- **Model:** GPT-3.5-Turbo
- **Cost:** ~$0.002 per request (500 tokens)
- **Rate Limit:** Depends on your OpenAI account tier
- **Recommendation:** Set up billing alerts in OpenAI dashboard

### College Scorecard API
- **Cost:** FREE (government API)
- **Rate Limit:** None specified
- **Reliability:** Very high (maintained by U.S. Department of Education)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chat doesn't work
- ✅ Check `.env` file exists with `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ✅ Check Vercel environment variables are set
- ✅ Check OpenAI account has credits
- ✅ Check browser console for errors

### College search returns no results
- ✅ Check `COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY` is set
- ✅ Try broader search terms
- ✅ Check API endpoint: `/api/college-search?name=test`

### Loading overlay doesn't disappear

- ✅ Check Firebase connection
- ✅ Check internet connection

### Questionnaire prompt doesn't show
- ✅ User must not have completed questionnaire
- ✅ Check `sessionStorage` - clear it and try again
- ✅ Wait 2 seconds after dashboard loads

---
