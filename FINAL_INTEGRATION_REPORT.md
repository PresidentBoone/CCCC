## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### AI Engine Architecture
```javascript
// Initialization
const aiEngine = new AIEngine(userId, db);
await aiEngine.initialize();

// Essay Analysis
const analysis = await aiEngine.analyzeEssay(essayText, {
  colleges: ['Stanford', 'MIT'],
  prompt: 'Common App Personal Statement',
  userProfile: userProfile
});

// College Matching
const matches = await aiEngine.findCollegeMatches();

// Test Prep
const questions = await aiEngine.generateTestPrepQuestions(
  'SAT', 'Math', 'medium', 10
);

const results = await aiEngine.analyzeTestPerformance({
  testType: 'SAT',
  questions: questions,
  answers: userAnswers,
  timeSpent: 1800
});
```

### Firestore Integration Pattern
```javascript
// In HTML (module script)
import { getDoc, doc, ... } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Expose to global scope
window.getDoc = getDoc;
window.doc = doc;
// ... etc

// In AI Engine (regular script)
const getDoc = window.getDoc;
const doc = window.doc;

// Use with fallbacks
if (getDoc && doc) {
  const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(this.db, 'users', userId));
  // ...
}
```

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- All Firestore operations wrapped in try-catch
- Fallback to default data if Firebase unavailable
- Console warnings for debugging
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages
