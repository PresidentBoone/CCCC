## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Mock System Works:
1. User clicks "Subscribe" button
2. Check: `window.mockPaymentSystem.isEnabled()` → returns `true`
3. Show mock checkout modal (not real Stripe)
4. User clicks "Complete Mock Payment ✓"
5. Simulate 1.5s API delay
6. Save to Firestore: `users/{userId}/subscription`
7. Redirect to success page
8. Dashboard reads subscription tier
9. Shows appropriate badge and features

### How to Switch to Real Stripe:
```javascript
// File: /public/js/payment/mock-payment-system.js
// Line 11:
const ENABLE_MOCK_PAYMENTS = false; // Change true → false

// Then configure:
// - Stripe API keys in .env
// - Real price IDs in pricing-init.js
// Everything else stays the same!
```
