## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. **Page Load Sequence**
```javascript
1. Load ai-engine-standalone.js (defines AIEngine class)
2. Load Firebase module script (initializes Firebase)
3. Expose Firestore functions to window
4. Auth state changes → User logs in
5. Initialize AIEngine with userId and db
6. AI Engine loads user profile and learning data
7. Features can now use AI Engine for personalized experiences
```

### 2. **Essay Analysis Flow**
```javascript
User writes essay
  ↓
Click "Analyze Essay"
  ↓
aiEngine.analyzeEssay(essay, options)
  ↓
Fetches /api/essay-analyze with user context
  ↓
OpenAI analyzes essay
  ↓
AI Engine updates learning data:
  - Writing style
  - Common topics
  - Preferences
  ↓
Save essay + analysis to /essays collection
  ↓
Display results to user
```

### 3. **Test Prep Flow**
```javascript
User requests practice questions
  ↓
aiEngine.generateTestPrepQuestions(type, subject, difficulty)
  ↓
Fetches /api/testprep-generate with:
  - User's strengths (from learning data)
  - User's weaknesses (from learning data)
  ↓
OpenAI generates targeted questions
  ↓
User completes test
  ↓
aiEngine.analyzeTestPerformance(results)
  ↓
Calculates scores, identifies weak subjects
  ↓
Updates /aiLearning with new strengths/weaknesses
  ↓
Generates study recommendations
```

### 4. **College Discovery Flow**
```javascript
User searches for colleges
  ↓
aiEngine.findCollegeMatches(preferences)
  ↓
Fetches /api/college-search with:
  - User profile data
  - Learned college preferences
  ↓
AI matches colleges based on fit
  ↓
Tracks which colleges user interacts with
  ↓

## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Why Standalone AI Engine?
- HTML files use `<script src="...">` tags (not ES6 modules)
- Firebase is loaded as ES6 module (type="module")
- AI Engine needs both approaches to work together
- Solution: Expose Firestore functions to global scope

### Error Handling
- AI Engine gracefully handles missing Firestore functions
- Falls back to default data if Firebase unavailable
- All async operations have try-catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance
- AI Engine initializes on first user auth
- Learning data cached in memory
- Firestore updates batched when possible
- Minimal API calls (only when needed)
