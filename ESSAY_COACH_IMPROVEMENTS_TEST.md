## üêõ Known Issues to Check

### Potential Problems with Copy Button:

1. **Special Characters in Suggestion:**
   - Problem: Single quotes in suggestion might break onclick handler
   - Test: Find suggestion with apostrophe ("don't", "can't")
   - Fix: We used `.replace(/'/g, "\\'")` - verify it works

2. **Very Long Suggestions:**
   - Problem: Toast might overflow screen
   - Test: Find a suggestion with 200+ characters
   - Fix: Toast has min-width: 250px but no max-width

3. **Multiple Clicks:**
   - Problem: Creating multiple toast notifications
   - Test: Click Copy button 5 times rapidly
   - Fix: Should work (old toasts removed after 3 sec)

4. **Clipboard Permission:**
   - Problem: Modern browsers might block clipboard access
   - Test: In privacy-focused browser (Brave, Firefox strict mode)
   - Fix: Fallback to document.execCommand should work

### Potential Problems with Keyboard Shortcuts:

1. **Conflict with Browser Defaults:**
   - Problem: Cmd+E might trigger address bar search in some browsers
   - Test: Try in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Fix: e.preventDefault() should work

2. **Focus Issues:**
   - Problem: Shortcuts might not work when focused in other inputs
   - Test: Focus on essay title field, press Cmd+S
   - Expected: Should still save (document-level listener)

3. **Mac vs Windows:**
   - Problem: Mac uses Cmd, Windows uses Ctrl
   - Test: Our code detects platform
   - Verify: `navigator.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf('MAC')`

### Potential Problems with Skeleton Loading:

1. **Skeleton Not Appearing:**
   - Problem: Elements might not exist when method is called
   - Test: Check browser console for errors
   - Fix: We check for null/undefined before manipulating DOM

2. **Skeleton Not Disappearing:**
   - Problem: Real results might append instead of replace
   - Test: Multiple analysis runs
   - Fix: displayAnalysisResults clears innerHTML first

3. **Animation Performance:**
   - Problem: Shimmer animation might be choppy on slow devices
   - Test: On older laptops or lower-end devices
   - Fix: CSS animations are GPU-accelerated (should be smooth)

4. **Dark Mode Contrast:**
   - Problem: Skeleton might be invisible in dark mode
   - Test: Toggle to dark mode and run analysis
   - Fix: We have separate dark mode gradient colors

5. **Timing Issues:**
   - Problem: Very fast API responses might cause flash
   - Test: On local network with fast response (<500ms)
   - Expected: Brief skeleton is acceptable, shows something is happening

### Potential Problems with Highlight Colors & Legend:

1. **Contrast Too Strong:**
   - Problem: New 0.3 opacity might be too bright
   - Test: View on different screen brightness levels
   - Fix: Can reduce to 0.28 if needed

2. **Icons Not Loading:**
   - Problem: FontAwesome icons might not display
   - Test: Check if icons appear as squares/blank
   - Fix: Verify FontAwesome CSS is loaded

3. **Legend Layout Breaking:**
   - Problem: Long text might wrap awkwardly
   - Test: Check on narrow viewports
   - Fix: Flexbox should handle this, but may need adjustment

4. **Hover Animation Performance:**
   - Problem: Multiple transitions might lag on slow devices
   - Test: On older computers
   - Fix: Transitions are simple CSS (should be fine)

5. **Color Mismatch:**
   - Problem: Legend color boxes might not exactly match highlights
   - Test: Visual comparison
   - Fix: We use same gradient values, should match
