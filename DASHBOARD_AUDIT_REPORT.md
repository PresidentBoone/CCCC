## 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Product Tour Auto-Start Logic
- **Location:** `js/product-tour.js` line 345-348
- **Issue:** Tour was checking `localStorage.getItem('onboardingCompleted')` but onboarding saves completion status to Firestore, not localStorage
- **Impact:** Tour would never auto-start after onboarding
- **Fix Applied:** Removed localStorage onboarding check from `shouldAutoStart()`, now only checks if tour itself was completed
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Before:**
```javascript
shouldAutoStart() {
    return !localStorage.getItem('productTourCompleted') &&
           localStorage.getItem('onboardingCompleted') === 'true';
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
shouldAutoStart() {
    // Only check if tour was completed, not onboarding
    // Onboarding state is checked in dashboard initialization
    return !localStorage.getItem('productTourCompleted');
}
```

### No Other Bugs Found ✅
