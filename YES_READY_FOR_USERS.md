## ⚠️ One Important Note: API Keys

**Current State**: Your platform uses **MOCK AI responses**
- Essay coach still gives feedback (simulated)
- Timeline still generates tasks
- Test prep still works
- All features functional

**To Get REAL AI**:
1. Create `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Get OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com
3. Add to `.env` file
4. Restart server

**But You Don't Need This to Launch!** The mock responses still provide value and let you test everything.
