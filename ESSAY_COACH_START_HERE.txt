🎨 VISUAL EXAMPLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE:
  [Highlight with tooltip: "This could be better"]

AFTER:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 🔴 #1 Cliché                           [RED]    │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ "I've always been passionate about science"     │
  │                                                  │
  │ ❓ WHY: This phrase appears in thousands of     │
  │ college essays. It doesn't show your unique     │
  │ voice or what makes your interest special.      │
  │                                                  │
  │ 🔧 HOW TO IMPROVE:                              │
  │ 1. Describe a specific moment that sparked it   │
  │ 2. Show passion through actions, not words      │
  │ 3. Use concrete sensory details                 │
  │                                                  │
  │ 💡 SUGGESTION:                                  │
  │ "The smell of formaldehyde hit me as I peered   │
  │ through the microscope at the paramecium..."    │
