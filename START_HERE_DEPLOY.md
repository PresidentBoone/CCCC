## 🎓 For Students Using Essay Coach

They will now get feedback like:

**Highlight:** "passionate about helping others"
- 🔴 **WHY:** This is a cliché phrase used in thousands of college essays. It doesn't differentiate you or show your unique perspective.
- 🔧 **HOW:** Replace generic statements with specific actions. Show what "helping others" looks like in your life through concrete examples.
- 💡 **SUGGESTION:** "When I noticed elderly neighbors struggling with groceries, I started a weekly grocery delivery service with three friends, serving 15 families."
