## 🎓 Example Feedback

### Red Highlight Example
**Text:** "I've always been passionate about science"
**Category:** Cliché
**Why:** This phrase appears in thousands of college essays. Admission officers have read it countless times. It's a generic claim that doesn't show your unique relationship with science or what makes your interest distinct.
**How:** 
1. Replace with a specific moment that sparked your interest
2. Show your passion through actions, not declarations
3. Use concrete sensory details from a real experience
**Suggestion:** "The smell of formaldehyde hit me as I peered through the microscope at the paramecium zipping across the slide. That moment in ninth grade biology, watching something invisible to the naked eye move with such purpose, changed everything."

### Yellow Highlight Example
**Text:** "This experience taught me a lot"
**Category:** Vague
**Why:** "A lot" is too general. What specifically did you learn? This is a missed opportunity to show growth and reflection with concrete details.
**How:**
1. Identify 1-2 specific lessons or realizations
2. Connect the learning to a future goal or value
3. Use precise language instead of "a lot"
**Suggestion:** "This experience taught me that persistence beats talent when tackling complex problems—a lesson I carried into my robotics competitions."

### Green Highlight Example
**Text:** "I counted 47 ceiling tiles while lying on the hospital bed, my broken leg elevated at exactly 32 degrees"
**Category:** Strength
**Why:** Excellent use of specific details! The exact numbers create vivid imagery and show your observational nature. This is authentic voice—quirky, precise, and memorable.
**How:** Lean into this strength throughout your essay. Look for other moments where specific, unexpected details can replace generic descriptions.
