# CRITICAL FIX: ERR_FAILED & Auth Persistence Issues

## Problems Reported by User

1. **ERR_FAILED when opening pages**: "The webpage at https://collegeclimbai.com/dashboard.html might be temporarily down"
2. **Auth not persisting**: "It's also not keeping me logged in, which it should be because it was doing that earlier on"

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue #1: .html File Redirects Don't Match Vercel Rewrites

**The Problem:**
- All authentication and navigation code was redirecting to `.html` files directly (e.g., `/dashboard.html`, `/login.html`)
- Vercel `rewrites` configuration only defines clean URLs without extensions (e.g., `/dashboard` → `/dashboard.html`)
- When JavaScript tried to navigate to `/dashboard.html`, Vercel had **no route** for it → ERR_FAILED

**Where It Happened:**
```javascript
// BAD - This fails on Vercel
window.location.href = '/dashboard.html';  // No route exists!

// GOOD - This works
window.location.href = '/dashboard';        // Rewrite exists
```

**Most Critical File:**
- [public/js/unified-auth.js](public/js/unified-auth.js) - Contains **all authentication logic**
  - Line 130: Redirect after successful login → `/dashboard.html` ❌
  - Line 142: Redirect when not authenticated → `/login.html` ❌
  - Line 183: Redirect when no session → `/login.html` ❌
  - Line 191: Redirect when session expired → `/login.html` ❌
  - Line 261: Redirect after signout → `/login.html` ❌

Since unified-auth.js handles ALL auth flows, every single auth action was failing.

### Issue #2: Auth Persistence (Secondary Issue)

While the primary issue was routing, auth persistence may also have been affected because:
- Users couldn't reach protected pages to test persistence
- Firebase `browserLocalPersistence` is set correctly in [unified-auth.js:68](public/js/unified-auth.js#L68)
- Session storage with 24-hour timeout is implemented in lines 18-19

Once routing is fixed, auth persistence should work as designed.

### Changes Made

**Before:**
```javascript
// 54+ instances like this across codebase
window.location.href = 'login.html';
window.location.href = '/login.html';
window.location.href = 'dashboard.html';
window.location.href = '/dashboard.html';
window.location.href = 'essaycoach.html';
window.location.href = 'testprep-practice.html?sessionType=diagnostic';
```

**After:**
```javascript
// All converted to clean URLs
window.location.href = '/login';
window.location.href = '/dashboard';
window.location.href = '/essay-coach';
window.location.href = '/testprep-practice?sessionType=diagnostic';
```

### Vercel Routes Added

```json
{
  "source": "/profile",
  "destination": "/profile.html"
},
{
  "source": "/about",
  "destination": "/about.html"
}
```

## Technical Details

### How Vercel Routing Works

**vercel.json rewrites:**
```json
{
  "source": "/dashboard",
  "destination": "/dashboard.html"
}
```

This means:
- ✅ User visits `/dashboard` → Vercel serves `public/dashboard.html`
- ✅ JavaScript redirects to `/dashboard` → Works perfectly
- ❌ JavaScript redirects to `/dashboard.html` → **404 / ERR_FAILED** (no rewrite exists)

### Why .html Files Fail

Vercel's routing is **explicit**, not automatic. Each route must be defined in rewrites.

We could have added rewrites for every `.html` file:
```json
{
  "source": "/dashboard.html",
  "destination": "/dashboard.html"
}
```

But that's:
1. Redundant (doubles rewrite rules)
2. Exposes implementation details (.html extension)
3. Not how modern web apps work (clean URLs are standard)

**Better solution:** Fix all redirects to use clean URLs.

## Testing Checklist

Now that the fix is deployed, test these critical flows:

### 1. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Visit collegeclimbai.com (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- [ ] Login with email/password
- [ ] Should redirect to `/dashboard` successfully ✅
- [ ] Refresh page - should stay logged in ✅
- [ ] Close browser, reopen - should stay logged in for 24 hours ✅

### 2. Page Navigation
- [ ] Click navbar links (Dashboard, Essay Coach, Test Prep)
- [ ] Should navigate without ERR_FAILED ✅
- [ ] Click buttons on dashboard
- [ ] Should navigate to correct pages ✅

### 3. Logout Flow
- [ ] Click logout button
- [ ] Should redirect to `/login` successfully ✅
- [ ] Should not be able to access protected pages ✅

### 4. Signup Flow
- [ ] Visit `/signup`
- [ ] Create new account
- [ ] Should redirect to `/questions` successfully ✅
- [ ] Complete questions
- [ ] Should redirect to `/dashboard` ✅

### 5. Protected Pages
Test each protected page loads:
- [ ] `/dashboard`
- [ ] `/essay-coach`
- [ ] `/testprep`
- [ ] `/testprep-practice`
- [ ] `/timeline`
- [ ] `/discovery`
- [ ] `/scholarships`
- [ ] `/questions`
- [ ] `/profile`
- [ ] `/myapp`

### 6. Browser Console Check
- [ ] Open DevTools (F12)
- [ ] Check Console for errors
- [ ] Should see: "✅ User signed in: [email]"
- [ ] Should NOT see: 404 errors or ERR_FAILED

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### What Should Work Now

1. **Login**: Login form submits → redirects to `/dashboard` → page loads ✅
2. **Protected Pages**: Accessing `/dashboard` without auth → redirects to `/login` ✅
3. **Navigation**: All navbar/button clicks use clean URLs → pages load ✅
4. **Auth Persistence**:
   - Session saved to localStorage with 24-hour expiry
   - Firebase uses `browserLocalPersistence`
   - Survives page refresh and browser restart (24h limit)

### What Won't Work Yet (Requires Environment Variables)

Firebase features won't work until you set environment variables in Vercel:
- User signup/login (needs Firebase Auth)
- Database operations (needs Firestore)
- Real-time data sync

**Required Env Vars:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
OPENAI_API_KEY
COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY
```

Set these in: **Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**

## Deployment Info

**Git Commit:** `19ba7b2`
**Commit Message:** "CRITICAL FIX: Replace all .html redirects with clean URLs"
**Files Changed:** 30 files, 394 insertions(+), 175 deletions(-)
**Push Time:** Just now

**Vercel Status:** Auto-deploying from GitHub push
**Expected Deploy Time:** ~10-30 seconds

---

## What Changed From User's Perspective

### Before (Broken)
1. User logs in → JS tries to redirect to `/dashboard.html`
2. Vercel: "I don't have a route for `/dashboard.html`"
3. Browser shows: **ERR_FAILED** or **404**
4. User sees: "The webpage at https://collegeclimbai.com/dashboard.html might be temporarily down"

### After (Fixed)
1. User logs in → JS redirects to `/dashboard`
2. Vercel: "I have a rewrite for `/dashboard` → serve `dashboard.html`"
3. Browser loads: **Dashboard page successfully** ✅
4. User sees: **Working dashboard**

---

## Files to Review

**Most Critical:**
- [public/js/unified-auth.js](public/js/unified-auth.js) - All 5 auth redirects fixed
- [vercel.json](vercel.json) - Clean URL routes defined

**Navigation:**
- [public/js/navbar-init.js](public/js/navbar-init.js) - Navbar logout and auth checks
- [public/dashboard.html](public/dashboard.html) - All onclick handlers

**Reference:**
- [DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESSFUL.md](DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESSFUL.md) - Previous deployment docs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment** (~30 seconds from push)
2. **Test the live site** at https://collegeclimbai.com
3. **Report back:**
   - Does login work?
   - Can you access dashboard?
   - Any errors in console?
   - Does auth persist after refresh?

If issues remain, share:
- Browser console errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Network errors (F12 → Network tab)
- Exact steps to reproduce

## Why This Fix Took 54+ Changes

Every place in the code that navigates to another page needed updating:
- Onclick handlers in HTML
- JavaScript redirects
- Auth success callbacks
- Error handlers
- Navbar links
- Button actions
- Card clicks
- Form submissions

This is why it's critical to use a **consistent routing pattern** from the start. Now all navigation uses clean URLs matching Vercel's rewrites.
