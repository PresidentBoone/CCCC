## If Something Doesn't Work

### Navbar shows "Guest"
**Cause:** Firestore data not loading  
**Check:** 
- Firebase credentials in config
- User document exists in `/users/{uid}`
- Browser console for errors

### Essays don't load
**Cause:** API endpoint not running  
**Check:**
- `/api/essay-storage` endpoint exists
- Vercel serverless functions deployed
- Browser console for 404 errors

### AI Analysis fails
**Cause:** OpenAI API key missing  
**Check:**
- `.env` has `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `/api/essay-analyze` endpoint exists
- API key is valid

### Save button doesn't work
**Cause:** User not authenticated  
**Check:**
- Firebase Auth is initialized
- User is logged in
- `currentUser` is not null

## Console Commands to Debug

### Check if user is logged in:
```javascript
// In browser console on essaycoach.html
console.log(window.currentUser);
// Should show: {uid: "...", email: "...", ...}
```

### Check if navbar updated:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(document.getElementById('ccUserAvatar').src);
// Should show: user's avatar URL

console.log(document.getElementById('ccDropdownName').textContent);
// Should show: user's name
```

### Check if essays loaded:
```javascript
// In browser console
document.getElementById('essayList').innerHTML;
// Should show: HTML with essay items
```
