## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### Critical Error in discovery.html

**Problem:**
- Same issue as dashboard.html - duplicate `<script src="/js/firebase-config.js"></script>` tag was inserted **inside** a `<script type="module">` block
- This caused HTML parser errors and prevented the page from loading correctly

**Location:**
```html
<script type="module">
    import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged, signOut } from '...';
    <script src="/js/firebase-config.js"></script>  ← WRONG!
    import { getFirestore, doc, getDoc, ... } from '...';
```

**Fix Applied:**
```html
<script type="module">
    import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged, signOut } from '...';
    import { getFirestore, doc, getDoc, ... } from '...';
    // Removed the duplicate script tag
```
