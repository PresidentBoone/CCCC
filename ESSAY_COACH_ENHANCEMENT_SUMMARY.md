## 🎨 Example Feedback Card

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔴 #1 Cliché                           [RED]    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Highlighted text: "I've always been passionate" │
│                                                  │
│ ❓ Why this is highlighted:                     │
│ This phrase appears in thousands of college     │
│ essays. Admission officers have read it         │
│ countless times. It's a generic claim that      │
│ doesn't show your unique relationship with the  │
│ subject or what makes your interest distinct.   │
│                                                  │
│ 🔧 How to improve:                              │
│ 1. Replace with a specific moment that sparked  │
│    your interest                                │
│ 2. Show your passion through actions, not       │
│    declarations                                 │
│ 3. Use concrete sensory details from a real     │
│    experience                                   │
│                                                  │
│ 💡 Suggestion:                                  │
│ "The smell of formaldehyde hit me as I peered  │
│ through the microscope at the paramecium        │
│ zipping across the slide. That moment in ninth  │
│ grade biology, watching something invisible to  │
│ the naked eye move with such purpose, changed   │
│ everything."                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
